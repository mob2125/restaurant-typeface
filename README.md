# Zomato Restaurant Finder

> Hello! This project is a complete website and server for finding restaurants using Zomato's data. It was built to show skills in creating a backend, designing an API, working with databases, and making a modern, interactive website.

## What it Does

The goal was to build a useful and good-looking app. I started with the raw data, created an organized database for it, built a backend to send that data to the website, and finally designed a user-friendly site to display everything.

## Features

This app has a lot of cool features:

* **Modern Homepage:** A beautiful main page with animations that shows featured restaurants and different food categories.

* **Restaurant Details Page:** You can click on any restaurant to see its own special page with more information.

* **Easy Text Search:** A main search bar that lets you find restaurants by typing in a name or a type of food (like "Pizza" or "Burger").

* **Advanced Search Options:** A hidden panel slides out to let you filter restaurants by Country, price, and other specific details.

* **Search for Restaurants Nearby:** A very fast location search that finds all restaurants within a certain distance of you. This uses a special database tool called PostGIS to make it extra efficient.

* **Search with a Photo:** You can upload a picture of food, and the app uses an AI model to figure out what it is and then shows you restaurants that serve that dish.

* **Smart Page Loading:** The app loads restaurant lists page-by-page, so it always feels fast and responsive, even with thousands of restaurants.

* **Clean and Organized Code:** The code for the website is split into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which is a professional practice that makes it easy to manage.
